# Builds the deep-ep (DeepEP) wheel with the toolchain verl's
# docker/Dockerfile.uv.cu130 sets up for its own source build of the same
# pinned commit - system NVSHMEM at that image's absolute path, CCCL headers on
# CPATH, an Ampere+Hopper+Blackwell arch list on x86_64 - swapping the in-place
# `uv sync` build for `pip wheel --no-deps -w dist` so a distributable artifact
# is produced.
# Run with CWD = the DeepEP submodule checkout.
#
# Caveat carried over from that source build: setup.py's second extension
# (hybrid_ep_cpp) bakes `-DBASE_PATH="<build dir>"` in for its runtime JIT, so
# in a prebuilt wheel that path points at this runner's checkout. verl does not
# use the hybrid-EP backend, and its own build has the same property (uv builds
# in a throwaway temp env that is gone by run time), so nothing regresses here.

# is a process-global compile flag and also asserts NVSHMEM is off. When the
# arch list includes any SM older than 9.0 (8.0 A100, 8.6/8.9 Ada), rewrite
# the checkout so those passes use the existing Ampere intranode paths and
# host launch dispatches on the runtime SM version, while 9.0/10.0 keep
# TMA, cluster launch and NVSHMEM. Internode / low-latency stay Hopper-only
# (pre-Hopper parts are intranode-only, matching upstream). The patch keys
# its device guards on __CUDA_ARCH__ < 900, so one rewrite covers every
# pre-Hopper token. aarch64 lists no such arch, so this is a no-op there.
