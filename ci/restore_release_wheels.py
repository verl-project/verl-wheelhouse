"""One-time recovery: republish wheels from workflow artifacts to a release.

Before releases were keyed by torch version, bumping torch in versions.yaml
re-uploaded wheels onto the *same* release, overwriting the previous torch's
assets (the wheel filename records no torch, so the names collide). The
overwritten wheels are not lost while their build's workflow artifacts are
still within the repo's 90-day retention: every _build.yml run uploads each
wheel as "wheel-<component>-<arch>-cu<cuda>-py<python>-torch<torch>".

This script reads those artifacts and publishes them to the release the new
tag scheme gives them, so a torch world that was clobbered becomes
installable again without recompiling anything.

Release titles are computed from versions.yaml *as of the commit that
produced the artifacts* (--versions-ref), so they describe the build that
actually happened rather than today's matrix. No build manifest is attached:
a restored release is not a reproducible skip-detection target, and writing
one from today's build scripts would claim a provenance these wheels do not
have. Push builds never consult it either - the matrix has moved on to
another torch, which is a different release.

Usage:
    python ci/restore_release_wheels.py --repo <owner>/<repo> \\
        --run 34934509976 --run 34941009059 --versions-ref 815a454     # dry run
    ... --apply
