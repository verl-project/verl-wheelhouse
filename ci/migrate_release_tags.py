"""One-time migration: retag existing releases to the per-torch tag scheme.

Releases used to be keyed by (component, Python) with the legacy interpreter
on a bare "<component>-<ref>" tag; they are now keyed by (component, Python,
torch) - see release_tag in ci/generate_matrix.py. This script renames the
releases already on GitHub to match, so their assets keep their identity
instead of being rebuilt:

    apex-master              -> apex-master-py3.12-torch2.13.0
    apex-master-py3.11       -> apex-master-py3.11-torch2.13.0

Nothing is recompiled and no asset is re-uploaded; `gh release edit --tag`
only moves the release (and creates the new git tag). The old tag's download
URLs stop resolving, which is the intended outcome: a 404 is a loud signal to
re-pin, where the previous behaviour - a torch bump silently overwriting the
wheels behind a URL that lock files already reference - was a silent ABI
mismatch.

The new tag is derived from the release *title*, which release_meta.py
generates as "<component> <ref> - [<arch> ]cu<cuda> py<python> torch<torch>",
so the component/ref split never has to be guessed out of a dash-separated
tag. Two consequences worth knowing before running it:

  * Run it only when no build is in flight. A release's title is refreshed
    at the start of a build and its wheels are uploaded at the end, so a
    running build means the title already describes a torch the attached
    wheels are not from yet - and retagging mid-run also moves the release
    out from under the job's own upload step.
  * `gh release edit --tag` creates the new git tag but leaves the old one
    behind, pointing at the same commit with no release on it. Prune them
    with `git push --delete origin <old-tag>` once the new tags look right.

Usage:
    python ci/migrate_release_tags.py --repo <owner>/<repo>            # dry run
    python ci/migrate_release_tags.py --repo <owner>/<repo> --apply
