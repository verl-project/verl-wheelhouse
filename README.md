# verl-wheelhouse

A GitHub Actions-based "wheelhouse" that builds prebuilt CUDA wheels for the
heavy native-extension dependencies of [verl](https://github.com/verl-project/verl):

| Component | Submodule path | What gets built |
|---|---|---|
| [apex](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex) | `apex` | full apex (`--cpp_ext --cuda_ext`) |
| [TransformerEngine](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TransformerEngine) | `TransformerEngine` | PyTorch TE extension |
| [flash-attention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention) | `flash-attention` | `flash_attn` |
| [flashinfer](https://github.com/flashinfer-ai/flashinfer) | `flashinfer` | `flashinfer-python`, `flashinfer-cubin`, `flashinfer-jit-cache` |
| [Megatron-Bridge](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge) | `Megatron-Bridge` | `megatron-bridge` (pure-Python `py3-none-any` wheel) |
| [DeepEP](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepEP) | `DeepEP` | `deep-ep` (MoE all-to-all, linked against NVSHMEM) |
| [FlashMLA](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/FlashMLA) | `FlashMLA` | `flash-mla` (MLA decode/prefill, `sm90a` + `sm100f`) |

The rollout engines (`vllm`, `sglang`) are deliberately *not* built here -
upstream's own published wheels are used instead.

Build commands follow the exact flags used in verl's own
[`docker/Dockerfile.stable.sglang`](https://github.com/verl-project/verl/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile.stable.sglang)
and
[`docker/Dockerfile.stable.vllm`](https://github.com/verl-project/verl/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile.stable.vllm),
and the GitHub Actions structure mirrors flash-attention's own
[`_build.yml`](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/blob/main/.github/workflows/_build.yml)
reusable workflow, including its resource-saving tricks for standard
GitHub-hosted runners (disk cleanup, swap space, capped parallelism,
resumable build caches).

Wheels are published to [GitHub Releases](../../releases) - one persistent
release per component, named after that component and its pinned dependency
versions (e.g. `transformer-engine v2.16.1 - cu13.0.2 py3.12 torch2.11.0`, tag
`transformer-engine-v2.16.1`) - and to a static [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
PEP 503 "simple" package index, so they're directly `pip install`-able.

## The version map (`versions.yaml`)

Everything version-related lives in one editable, plain-data YAML file at
the project's base directory - no Python, no workflow YAML - needs to
change for routine version bumps:

- **`build_matrix`**: the CPU arch / CUDA / Python / Torch combinations to
  build. Seeded with CUDA `13.0.2`, Python `3.12`, Torch `2.11.0` (matching
  both verl Dockerfiles' `ARG` defaults), on `x86_64` and `aarch64`. Add
  another entry to build more combinations - every component is built once
  per entry here, minus the ones its `arches` filter excludes.
- **`components`**: per-submodule config - the git `ref` to build (branch,
  tag, or commit; overrides whatever commit the submodule pointer in this
  repo is on), which `ci/build_scripts/<builder>.sh` to run, the CUDA arch
  list, whether cuDNN is required, `max_jobs`, the runner label, which CPU
  arches to build for (`arches`) with optional per-arch field overrides
  (`arch_overrides`), and any extra environment variables.
- **`verl_reference_versions`**: versions verl's Dockerfiles pin for things
  this repo does *not* build (`transformers`, `trl`, `nsight_systems`,
  `megatron`, `verl` itself) - tracked here purely for compatibility
  bookkeeping.

To add a new arch/CUDA/Python/Torch combination, append an entry to
`build_matrix`. To bump a component's version, edit its `ref`. To add a
brand-new component, add an entry to `components` and a matching
`ci/build_scripts/<builder>.sh`.

See [docs/maintaining-components.md](docs/maintaining-components.md) for
the full step-by-step guide (with a worked example) to both of these tasks.
A matching Cursor Agent Skill
([.cursor/skills/manage-wheelhouse-components](.cursor/skills/manage-wheelhouse-components/SKILL.md))
lets an agent apply the same checklist automatically.

`ci/generate_matrix.py` is the only code that reads `versions.yaml`; it
turns it into the flat JSON matrix GitHub Actions consumes. Inspect the
resulting matrix locally at any time (requires `pip install pyyaml`):

```bash
python3 ci/generate_matrix.py --list-components
python3 ci/generate_matrix.py --component apex | python3 -m json.tool
python3 ci/generate_matrix.py --component all
```

## Releases: one persistent release per component

Every component gets its **own** GitHub Release - there is no single
combined release for "the repo" as a whole. `ci/release_meta.py` computes,
for a component and its currently-pinned `ref` in `versions.yaml`:

- **tag**: `<component>-<ref>`, e.g. `transformer-engine-v2.16.1`
- **title**: `<component> <ref> - [<arch> ]cu<cuda> py<python> torch<torch>[; ...]`
  (one segment per `build_matrix` entry the component is built for, with the
  `x86_64` arch left implicit), e.g. `transformer-engine v2.16.1 - cu13.0.2
  py3.12 torch2.11.0` or `flash-attention v2.8.3 - cu13.0.2 py3.12
  torch2.11.0; aarch64 cu13.0.2 py3.12 torch2.11.0`

The reusable `.github/workflows/_ensure_release.yml` workflow creates that
release if it doesn't exist yet, or refreshes its title (in case
`build_matrix` changed) if it does. Rebuilding the same `ref` re-uploads
(`--clobber`) wheels onto that same release; bumping a component's `ref` in
`versions.yaml` starts a **brand-new** release under a new tag, leaving the
previous release (and its wheels) attached to the old `ref` untouched as a
historical record.

## Triggering builds

- Each component has its own workflow (`build-<component>.yml`) that can be
  run on demand from the Actions tab (`workflow_dispatch`), and also runs
  automatically on pushes to `main` (including PR merges) that touch
  `versions.yaml`, `ci/generate_matrix.py`, `ci/build_scripts/common.sh`, or
  that component's build script.
- Every arch/CUDA/Python/Torch combination is an independent job on its own
  runner, with its own build cache and wheel artifact, and `fail-fast: false`
  keeps one failure from cancelling the others. A manual run additionally
  takes an **arch** choice (`all` / `x86_64` / `aarch64`), so you can test one
  architecture without spending hours of runner time on the others; a
  component that doesn't opt into the chosen arch simply has nothing to build
  and its build job is skipped. Pushes always build every arch.
- On a push, the workflow first checks the component's target release. If its
  title exactly matches the configured arch/CUDA/Python/Torch matrix and it
  contains every distribution listed in that component's `wheel_packages` for
  every arch it builds (matched on each wheel's own platform tag, so an
  x86_64 wheel never stands in for a missing aarch64 one), the build is
  skipped. Otherwise, a successful build ensures/updates the release, uploads
  the wheel(s), and re-runs `publish-index.yml`. Manual `workflow_dispatch`
  runs always build but skip publishing, so they can force a fresh test build.
- `build-all.yml` builds every component and also runs on a weekly schedule
  as a sanity sweep (the schedule always covers every arch; a manual run
  takes the same arch choice as the per-component workflows). It does **not**
  publish - it's for validating the whole matrix still builds cleanly.
- Pushing a tag matching `v*` runs `release.yml`, which is purely a
  trigger - the tag itself is not a release. It runs the full component x
  matrix sweep and, for every component, ensures/updates that same
  per-component release described above and uploads every wheel, then
  finishes by republishing the package index. Use this to force a fresh,
  citable rebuild of everything at once; ordinary `main` pushes already keep
  each component's release up to date incrementally.
- `publish-index.yml` can also be run standalone (or fires automatically
  whenever a release is published/edited/deleted) to refresh the index
  without rebuilding any wheels.

> **Note on the very first push to a brand-new repo/branch:** GitHub sets
> the push event's "before" commit to all-zeros when a branch has no prior
> history, and `paths`-filtered `push` triggers silently don't fire for that
> specific push (a longstanding GitHub Actions quirk, not specific to this
> repo). Every *subsequent* push behaves normally. If nothing ran after your
> very first push, just trigger the relevant `build-<component>.yml` once
> via `workflow_dispatch` (or push any follow-up change) to prime things.

## Installing built wheels

The index is published to GitHub Pages at
<https://verl-project.github.io/verl-wheelhouse/simple/>, and is refreshed
whenever a wheel lands on a component's release (from a `main` push or a
`release.yml` sweep):

```bash
pip install --extra-index-url https://verl-project.github.io/verl-wheelhouse/simple/ flash-attn
pip install --extra-index-url https://verl-project.github.io/verl-wheelhouse/simple/ transformer-engine
```

Or install a specific wheel directly from that component's
[release page](../../releases) - look for the tag `<component>-<ref>`, e.g.
`transformer-engine-v2.16.1`.

On a fork, substitute your own `https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/simple/`
and enable Pages first (Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions);
everything in `ci/` and `.github/workflows/` derives the repo it is running
in from `${{ github.repository }}`, so no other change is needed.

## Caveats

- **Every package is available for arm64, but not every component has an
  arm64 job.** The `build_matrix` covers `x86_64` and `aarch64`, and
  `flash-attention`, `apex`, `TransformerEngine`, `flashinfer`, `deep-ep` and
  `flash-mla` all build both. `Megatron-Bridge` deliberately stays `arches: [x86_64]`: its wheel is
  `py3-none-any`, so the single x86_64 build already installs on arm64, and a
  second job would only race a byte-identical asset name onto the same
  release. `flashinfer` is a hybrid for the same reason - two of its three
  wheels are `py3-none-any`, so `flashinfer.sh` emits those on x86_64 only and
  the arm64 job contributes just the arch-specific `flashinfer-jit-cache`.
- **arm64 always builds on GitHub-hosted runners.** The self-hosted machine is
  x86_64-only, so every `arch_overrides.aarch64` points at `ubuntu-24.04-arm`
  (GitHub's free 4 vCPU / 16 GB arm64 runner) rather than waiting on arm
  hardware that doesn't exist. `ci/generate_matrix.py` fails the matrix if a
  non-x86_64 row names a self-hosted runner, and `_build.yml` separately
  asserts the runner's `uname -m` matches the row's arch. The practical cost
  is parallelism: `apex` drops from `max_jobs: 32` to `2` and
  `TransformerEngine` from an effective 64 compile threads to 4, so both are
  expected to exhaust their 5h budget and finish across a few re-runs off the
  resumable build cache. Everything else the toolchain needs already works
  there: `Jimver/cuda-toolkit` rewrites its apt repo path to NVIDIA's `sbsa`
  one, `common.sh`'s `install_cudnn` maps `aarch64` → `sbsa`, and
  download.pytorch.org publishes `manylinux_2_28_aarch64` CUDA wheels. Both
  arches' wheels live on the same per-component release and the PEP 503
  index lists them side by side - pip picks by platform tag.
- **Two components build on a self-hosted machine (x86_64 only).** `apex` and
  `TransformerEngine` are the heavy CUDA builds here, so their `runs_on`
  points at a self-hosted runner (`[self-hosted, Linux, X64]`) and their
  `max_jobs` is raised accordingly (32 and 16 - TransformerEngine multiplies
  that by `NVTE_BUILD_THREADS_PER_JOB=4`). Their aarch64 rows fall back to
  GitHub's arm64 runner, as above. `flash-attention`, `flashinfer` and
  `Megatron-Bridge` stay on free GitHub-hosted runners on both arches with
  capped parallelism. `runs-on` and `max_jobs` are both plain per-component
  fields in `versions.yaml`, so moving a component between the two (or dialing
  parallelism up towards verl's own `128`/`256`) is a one-line edit with no
  workflow changes.
- **Build time on free runners.** Builds that stay on GitHub-hosted runners
  are slow even with capped `MAX_JOBS`/arch lists. The reusable workflow caps
  each build attempt at 5 hours (under GitHub's 6h job limit) and saves a
  resumable build-cache tarball on timeout, so re-running the workflow
  continues from where it left off - the same tradeoff flash-attention's own
  CI makes.
- **Self-hosted runners can route GitHub transfers through a proxy.** The
  self-hosted machine's direct egress to GitHub is slow and prone to hanging,
  which stalls the wheel/artifact and release uploads (and the resumable
  build cache). Set an optional `BYTED_PROXY` repository secret to an HTTP(S)
  egress proxy URL and those transfers are routed through it. It only takes
  effect on self-hosted runners (`runner.environment == 'self-hosted'`);
  GitHub-hosted builds always use a direct connection, so leaving the secret
  unset is a no-op for them. Only the self-hosted components' workflows
  forward it to the reusable `_build.yml`: `build-apex.yml`,
  `build-transformer-engine.yml`, and the `build-all.yml`/`release.yml`
  sweeps. Because secrets are per-repository and do not follow a fork or
  transfer, a self-hosted build in a new repo warns up front when
  `BYTED_PROXY` is missing, and every transfer that would use it carries a
  `timeout-minutes` cap so a stalled upload fails within the hour instead of
  sitting on the runner until the job times out.
- **The DeepSeek kernels carry two constraints the other components don't.**
  `deep-ep` links NVSHMEM and bakes `-Wl,-rpath,$NVSHMEM_DIR/lib` into its
  extension, so its wheel only resolves libnvshmem where that directory exists:
  `common.sh`'s `install_nvshmem` therefore installs
  `nvidia-nvshmem-cu<major>==<extra_env NVSHMEM_VERSION>` into
  `/usr/local/lib/python<X.Y>/dist-packages`, the same absolute path verl's
  `docker/Dockerfile.uv.cu130` installs it to. Bumping the NVSHMEM version on
  either side without the other leaves the wheel pointing at a directory the
  image no longer has. Both projects also append `+<short git sha>` to their
  own version with no opt-out; since GitHub rewrites `+` to `.` in release
  asset filenames (which would desync the filename from the wheel's own
  METADATA), `common.sh`'s `strip_wheel_local_version` removes the segment
  after the build. Their wheels are therefore plain `deep-ep 1.2.1` /
  `flash-mla 1.0.0`, and - as with `apex` - the exact commit lives in the
  release tag and title rather than in the version.
- **`apex` tracks `master`** (both verl Dockerfiles build it unpinned), so it
  effectively behaves like a rolling release under the fixed tag
  `apex-master`; every other component tracks a specific tag and gets a fresh
  release per version bump.
- **Old per-component releases aren't deleted automatically.** Bumping a
  `ref` starts a new release rather than replacing the old one, so the PEP
  503 index may list more than one version of a package (e.g. both
  `transformer-engine-v2.15` and `transformer-engine-v2.16.1` wheels) until
  you manually delete the stale release from the
  [releases page](../../releases) if that matters for your use case. The same
  applies to the retired `vllm-*`/`sglang-*` releases: dropping those
  components stops future builds but leaves their existing wheels published
  and indexed until the releases are deleted by hand.
